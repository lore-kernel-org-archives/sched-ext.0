> softirq: Treat an interrupted idle task as idle in tick_irq_exit()

TL;DR: Commit message only: claims the new is_idle_task() gate is "strictly
wider", but it also now covers idle-injection kthreads (PF_IDLE) and not some
early-boot cases; the changelog should say so.

The commit message says "The new gate is strictly wider than the old one,
and deliberately so", and lists the newly covered cases as nr_running > 0
while the idle task runs, and a queued TTWU_QUEUE wakeup. Is that accurate?

is_idle_task() tests PF_IDLE on current, which is a different predicate
from rq->curr == rq->idle.  play_idle_precise() sets PF_IDLE on a
SCHED_FIFO kthread and then loops on do_idle():

kernel/sched/idle.c:play_idle_precise() {
    ...
	current->flags |= PF_IDLE;
    ...
	while (!READ_ONCE(it.done))
		do_idle();
    ...
}

During idle injection rq->curr is that kthread, so the old gate was false
(except on nohz_full CPUs), while the new gate is true whenever
need_resched() is clear.  Interrupts during injected idle will now run
tick_nohz_irq_exit() with TS_FLAG_INIDLE set, which does
tick_nohz_clock_sleep(), updates ts->idle_entrytime, and may start kcpustat
idle accounting.  This affects users such as intel_powerclamp,
cpuidle_cooling and idle_inject, and is not limited to sched_ext.

Peter Zijlstra raised the same point on the earlier posting: "So
is_idle_task() is also true for idle-injection tasks. I *think* that is
also right in this case, but it wasn't mentioned."  No reply or changelog
update addressing it is visible.

Conversely, PF_IDLE is set by cpu_startup_entry(), not by init_idle(), so
a CPU running its idle task before that point (rq->curr == rq->idle,
nr_running == 0) satisfied idle_cpu() but does not satisfy
is_idle_task(current).  That looks harmless, since TS_FLAG_INIDLE is only
set inside do_idle() and nohz_full CPUs are still covered by
tick_nohz_full_cpu(cpu), but it means the gate is not strictly wider.

Could the commit message name the idle injection case among the newly
covered states, and replace "strictly wider" with wording that matches the
PF_IDLE semantics?
