Just the PTE.

Which is fine IMO, and how it should be. Alloc and free cycle sets it to NU=
LL,
so be it. Users can also do it in parallel, that case will just cause a fau=
lt in
the kernel again and we'll reset the PTE to the scratch page again.

Right.

It likely should also be zeroed out, to preserve the idea that reading
'faulting' regions returns zeroes. Let's just go with scratch page term.

I think the main idea is we install a page fault handler after the KCSAN on=
e,
from the fault handler, use bpf_prog_find_from_stack() to obtain the first
program in the stack trace, which will be the one originating the fault ins=
ide
the kernel. Then make sure the faulting address lies in the prog->aux->aren=
a,
(likely including guard pages in its range), and just install the PTE for t=
he
zeroed out scratch page at that point and continue.

I thought about various races, to me it seems it should be ok. If parallel
installation wins over us, it either installed a valid page replacing scrat=
ch
PTE, at which point we just let the kernel retry, or installed a scratch pa=
ge.
If it races and replaces existing scratch or valid page with NULL after we
checked, we fault again and retry. In any case, either the kernel continues=
 or
it ends up faulting again, at which point we can handle the fault again and
attempt to fix it up.

We likely need to make sure the existing thing is pte_none()  only install =
if
pte_none(), otherwise leave things as is. If racy attempts unmap and set sc=
ratch
or valid page to none, we will fault again and reinstall. If racy attempts
install scratch page or valid page, we let it be as is. More importantly we
shouldn't install scratch page over a valid page, I think.

Our PTE installation likely takes the form try_cmpxchg(pte, NULL, scratch_p=
age).

One corner case is that we may have cached scratch page TLB translations fo=
r a
range we are trying to alloc pages over. Typically the way to eliminate sta=
le
TLBs would be to just do flush_tlb_kernel_range(). In this case I wonder wh=
ether
we just skip it to avoid the cost and let the stale TLB stay, since it like=
ly
came due to program passing faultable memory into kernel.

That said, a cheaper fix would be to install PTEs under the lock not with
WRITE_ONCE() but xchg() so that we can inspect if we overwrote an entry tha=
t
had scratch page and only do the extra TLB flush in that case. I would be f=
ine
with either option (leaving it as is, or the above), as long as we document=
 it
somewhere (either in the commit log or a comment in the code), just so we d=
on't
forget.

The main question is, what are the next steps? Do you want to take a stab a=
t
implementing this?
