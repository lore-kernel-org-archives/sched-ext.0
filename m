> softirq: Treat an interrupted idle task as idle in tick_irq_exit()

TL;DR: Commit message only, no code issues: the changelog carries posting
notes (v1 history, dropped reproducer, compile-test matrix) that could move
below the '---' line.

This isn't a bug, but the changelog carries notes about the posting itself:

> The reproducer is a sched_ext scheduler that parks a tagged task on an
> otherwise idle CPU for a set time. It was patch 1 of v1 and is dropped

Could the notes about v1 and this posting (and perhaps the compile-test
matrix) move below the '---' line, leaving the Link: tag to point at the
reproducer?
