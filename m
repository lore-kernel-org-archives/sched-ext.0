Hi Michal,

Thanks for your detailed review! We appreciated for your time.

Yes the test in cgroup_iter_memcg involves using the flushing. Our concern is
how it ensures the state after the flush is correct. Existing approach in
cgroup_iter_memcg only checks whether the read value is non-zero, rather than
compare it with the actualy ones, e.g.,

	ASSERT_GT(memcg_query->nr_file_pages, 0, "final file value");
	ASSERT_GT(memcg_query->nr_file_mapped, 0, "final file mapped value");
	
This ensures the flush does happen and take effect, but it does not check the
flush take effect as expected. And this is why we want to compare with the file
reading: it is a stronger evidance for the correctness of the flush function.

Besides, another check missed from the cgroup_iter_memcg is that it contains no
accumulation tests for a cgroup subtree. Currently it only creates one children
cgroup and puts the reading task in it. The flush never have a chance to
merge-up the deltas in the leaves.

Another missing parts for the cgroup_iter_memcg is that it charges the memory
and then reads the stats on the same cpu, which means a (possible broken) flush
that processed only that CPU would pass the weak non-zero test. The new tests
strengthen the check by pin each child to multiple CPUs. This increase the code
length but greatly improves the test coverage.

We understand that kernel perfers short, dedicated codes and this is our
target as well. Please do let us know if you have any suggestions for test
design. Thanks!

Yes. In the v1 serials of this patch, we actually design another selftests which
simulates the real-world dynamic workloads, by making the leaf process keep
churn memory, and measure the results correspondingly. However this approach
incurs three problems:

	1) We have to manually wait the state become "steady", but it is hard to
	   quantilize the steady state for processes keep churning, so as for
	   real-world workloads.
	2) The error margin would be further increased in the highly dynamic worklaods,
	   and the confidence area for compare number narrows more;
	3) The code would be more complicated than this one.

So the current design is a compromise of the dynamic workloads and fault tolerance.

Keep the same style as other selftests in important for long-term maintaince. 
We totally agree with it and will cross check it in the next version.

Good suggestion, we will take more common cgroup functions functions in

Yes this misunderstanding mostly comes from the variable naming, we will fix it

I think it would be good set per_leaf tolerance rather than a total tolerance
since the errors merges up at root, may be we can try:

	stat_tol = leaves_below(node) * CHARGER_SLACK_PAGES * page_size;
	pgf_tol  = leaves_below(node) * CHARGER_SLACK_FAULTS;

Good catch, I will move them to the cg_node in next.

Yes. I just measure it and it seems the anon is identical but the pg_fault is
not. So maybe the two tree design is not necessary. I think maybe we can remove
two trees in the next version, but just perform one time flush and read from
both bpf and file. This can remove the noise and provide more accurate results.
What do you think?

Thanks for your review agian and detailed feedback!
