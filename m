Yeah this is why this solution does not interfere with any BPF arena code.
The allocator does not need to know about the scratch PTEs at all, it
can just allocate over them and automatically turns the address valid.

Let's skip the flush. When we hit races like that during the kfunc we shoul=

care more about completing the call than about the result since the
program is already buggy.

Can do, I will send a patch.
