Hello, Andrea.

I'm a bit skeptical about the premise. Unless p->scx.vtime/slice are used
for BPF side book-keeping, the only times they need to be modified are:

- When inserting into a vtime DSQ, vtime needs to be set. However, the
  interface functions already have provisions for setting vtime, so direct
  manipulation isn't necessary.

- slice can be simliar but can also be a bit more complicated. As slice only
  affects when the task actually gets on the CPU and a task may not have its
  eventual slice known at the time of its insertion into a user DSQ. In such
  cases, it may be necessary to set the slice as the task starts execution
  from e.g. ops.running().

- While a task is running, slice modification can be used to give the task
  more or less CPU time. Most commonly, these would be either extending
  slice to keep running the current task or preemting the task by setting
  the slice to zero and triggering a scheduling event.

So, as long as p->scx.vtime/slice are used to instruct the kernel what to
do, as opposed to being used for BPF side book-keeping, vtime doesn't need
to be directly modified at all and while slice may need to be modified,
those are mostly directly tied to actual scheduling operations and context
switches. I'd be surprised if the kfunc overhead is noticeable at all. kfunc
calls aren't expensive unless you're banging on it in a tight loop. Also,
note that in the lowest overhead scheduling scenario - direct dispatch to a
local DSQ from select_cpu()/enqueue() - neither is needed. It'd just be a
single scx_bpf_dsq_insert() call.

So, I'm not sure this is something we need to invest complexity into. The
only cases I can think of where the overhead might become visible is if the
BPF sched uses these fields for internal bookkeeping and keeps updating a
lot more times than there are actual scheduling events. However, I don't
think that's a usage model that we want to encourage.

Thanks.
